Are you interested in contributing to this project? We are very excited to receive issues and pull requests, and welcome contributions from all users.

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

We accept bug reports and feature requests from all contributors. Please follow the instructions below for our workflow.

### Feature Requests

Do you have a feature you would like to see added to Becca? Create a [new issue](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/Becca-Lyria/issues/new/choose) using the "Feature Request" template and we will get started on it as soon as we are able.

### Found a Bug

Did you discover a bug when interacting with Becca? Unfortunately, despite our best efforts we are still not quite perfect. You can submit a [new issue](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/Becca-Lyria/issues/new/choose) using the "Bug Report" template and we will address it as soon as possible.

## Writing Code for Becca

If you want to propose a new feature or bug fix for Becca's code, feel free to do so! We've included some helpful resources for you if you have any questions.

### Becca's Server

You are welcome to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PHqDbkg) to work with other developers and ask questions about Becca's code.

### Code Coverage

When submitting code changes, please ensure tests are added to cover your change or the expected behavior of code. We are using several frameworks to make implementing tests easier, and there are test-helper functions to keep these clean in `testSetup.ts`.

### Configure Becca

To set up your own instance of Becca, please review the [Developer Documentation](https://beccalyria.nhcarrigan.com/).
